Basics
======

PHP
---
The minimum required version of PHP for phpBB 4.0 is ``8.1`` with full support for versions ``8.2`` and ``8.3``.
PHP code that worked with the supported versions of phpBB 3.3 should work with phpBB 4.0 as well but might require minor adjustments.Recommendation

Symfony
-------
phpBB 4.0 ships with Symfony 6.4. There are quite a few changes to the standard Symfony version that came with phpBB 3.3.
The following upgrade guides provides by Symfony might help with resolving some of the issues you might encounter when upgrading
custom PHP or Extension code for phpBB 4.0:

- `Upgrade Symfony from 3.x to 4.0 <https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/4.4/UPGRADE-4.0.md>`_
- `Upgrade Symfony from 4.4 to 5.0 <https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/5.4/UPGRADE-5.0.md>`_
- `Upgrade Symfony from 5.x to 6.0 <https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/6.4/UPGRADE-6.0.md>`_

You can find more upgrade guides in the `Symfony Repository <https://github.com/symfony/symfony/tree/6.4>`_ on GitHub.

Major changes
=============

Ban system
----------
The ban system has been greatly refactored for phpBB 4.0. As part of this, the following changes were introduced:

- Added support for banning `CIDR blocks <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_blocks>`_
- Added support for IPv6 banning
- Removed "exclude" functionality which resulted in ambiguous settings
